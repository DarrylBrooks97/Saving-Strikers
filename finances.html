      <h4>Food</h4>
      <h5>How much to spend on food and what type of food to spend it on</h5>
          <p>The mistake college students often make is buying a lot of snacks. The problem with buying a lot of it is tht it does not last long. It is good for when you are in a hurry but it also easy to reach, which mean that any chance you'll get you will eat. So make sure to have some of them out of reach. Place them somewhere that you'll most likely have to get up to reach it. That will discourage you from having it, unless ofcourse you're hungry.</p>
      <h3>Eating Out</h3>
        <p>Avoid eating out if you are still looking for a job. Places you most likely be able to afford without a job is likely place like McDonal, Burger King, Taco Bell and such..</p>
        <p>Minimizing the amount of time you eat out a month (no more than once every two weeks). It is expected for you to get tired of eating in. Sometime you just want to eat anything else, but if you are still looking for job that could put a financial strained on you. You got to be aware of how much you can spend and not on how much you want to spend. It can be stressful when it comes to money but do not just think of the present but he future also.</p>
