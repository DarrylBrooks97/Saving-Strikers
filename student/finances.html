        <h3>Food</h3>
        <h4>How much to spend on food and what type of food to spend it on</h4>
        <p>
          The mistake college students often make is buying a lot of snacks. The
          problem with buying a lot of it is tht it does not last long. It is
          good for when you are in a hurry but it also easy to reach, which mean
          that any chance you'll get you will eat. So make sure to have some of
          them out of reach. Place them somewhere that you'll most likely have
          to get up to reach it. That will discourage you from having it, unless
          of course you're hungry.
        </p>

        <h3>Eating Out</h3>
        <p>
          Avoid eating out if you are still looking for a job. Places you most
          likely be able to afford without a job is likely place like McDonald,
          Burger King, Taco Bell and such..
        </p>
        <p>
          Minimizing the amount of time you eat out a month (no more than once
          every two weeks). It is expected for you to get tired of eating in.
          Sometime you just want to eat anything else, but if you are still
          looking for job that could put a financial strained on you. You got to
          be aware of how much you can spend and not on how much you want to
          spend. It can be stressful when it comes to money but do not just
          think of the present but he future also.
