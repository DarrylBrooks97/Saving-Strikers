            <h4>Apartment Picking</h4>
            <p>
               Picking the ideal apartment is a daunting task. You should start
               looking for the apartment at least 3 to 4 months before you decide to
               move in. You will need to pick an apartment with respect to the
               location and how long it takes to get to campus and/or work.
